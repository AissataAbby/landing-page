       It is hard challenging yourself..
       Yes it is!!
       <ul>
        <li> You can be afraid </li>
         <li> You can not feel enough </li>
          <li> You do not know where to start </li>
        </ul>
       <br>
       It is not easy changing your life but if you 'don't do it, no one will do it for you.
       <br/>
       It is your responsability to be happy and do the right thing for you.
         </br>
